{"TEXT": "The content pertains to a warning action taken by the Central Election Management Committee of Kyung Hee University. The warning was directed towards the Linkhu election campaign group in relation to specific electoral misconduct.The warning targets the election group represented by the total student council and the Linkhu election campaign group. The basis for this warning includes several regulations outlined in the election enforcement rules of Kyung Hee University's International Campus. Specifically, the rules prohibit actions such as providing money or favors to non-election personnel during the election period, engaging in defamation or spreading false information about other candidates or campaign groups, and interfering with the election process.The decision regarding the warning was made in a meeting held on November 14, 2024, between midnight and four in the morning. The minutes from this meeting will be uploaded for public access via the total student council's Instagram link tree. The committee examined allegations that an individual, referred to as Mr. Cha, allegedly asked another individual, referred to as Mr. A, to act as a spy for the Core Election Campaign Group. However, there was no concrete evidence to support the claims made by either the Linkhu campaign group or the Core campaign group, based solely on the submitted documentation. The committee reviewed specific evidence presented by the Core Election Campaign Group, including screenshots of conversations from KakaoTalk. The evidence suggested that a member of the Linkhu campaign group referred to Mr. A as a spy, which constituted a violation of the election enforcement rules. Additionally, it was revealed that Mr. A had shared personal information of Core campaign members with Mr. Cha, leading to further violations.The committee issued a warning to the Linkhu campaign group at 6:30 AM on November 13, 2024. In response, the Linkhu campaign group submitted a request for a re-evaluation of the warning later that same day. The committee addressed the re-evaluation request and questioned representatives from both campaign groups during the process. After careful consideration, the committee acknowledged parts of the re-evaluation request but maintained the warning against the Linkhu campaign group, citing insufficient evidence to support claims of espionage against Mr. A. The committee clarified that the period for conducting election activities is not limited strictly to the designated election period but also includes activities such as posting campaign materials and recruiting campaign personnel. Ultimately, the committee found no grounds to overturn the existing disciplinary action and issued a formal warning to the Linkhu campaign group. They are now required to publicly post an explanation and apology regarding the warning within 12 hours of receiving the notification.The Central Election Management Committee of Kyung Hee University oversees these proceedings and ensures compliance with electoral regulations.", "META": "International Student Council"}

{"TEXT": "The JSON content outlines various proposals aimed at enhancing the educational experience for students in the Business School. The proposals include expanding the range of major choices, easing graduation exam requirements, increasing scholarship opportunities for certification, augmenting English course offerings, and establishing a dedicated student council for the Business Department.Currently, in the Business School, there are not enough elective courses available compared to the number of enrolled students. This shortage limits students' career choices, prompting many to attend lectures offered by other departments. To address this issue, the school plans to broaden the recognition of elective courses from both the Business School and other departments to ensure better learning opportunities for students.The graduation exam requirements include an internship component, but the high competition for these opportunities means that they are limited. Additionally, many students are undertaking internships outside of the designated practical training. Therefore, the school proposes to recognize internship experiences outside of practical training as valid for fulfilling graduation exam requirements. Moreover, achievements in credible academic competitions and festivals will also be added as criteria to ease the graduation requirements.In terms of scholarship opportunities, while students acquire a variety of certifications, the current scholarship offerings for these certifications are not extensive. The school aims to expand the scope of certification scholarships to encourage students in their pursuit of various qualifications.Regarding English courses, there is a requirement for students to complete at least three English courses for graduation. However, the number of English courses available within the Business School is insufficient, limiting course selection. To improve this situation, the school plans to enhance the availability of English courses, which will help students meet graduation requirements more easily and provide a wider range of options for those enrolled in the English track.Finally, the existing student council for the Business School currently fulfills the roles of both the general student council and the Business Department student council. To strengthen representation for the Business Department, the school intends to establish a dedicated student council that will specifically advocate for the interests of Business students.In summary, these proposals reflect the school's commitment to improving academic offerings, enhancing scholarship opportunities, and providing better representation for students within the Business School.", "META": "khsom_official"}

It suggests that students at Kyung Hee University might be unsure about how to start engaging with ChatGPT, indicating the launch of a project aimed at helping them understand this tool. The Center for Teaching and Learning at Kyung Hee University is involved in this initiative.The second image discusses the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT. It highlights that ChatGPT produces creative and professional results unlike traditional AI chatbots. The application of reinforcement learning through human feedback allows it to simulate human-like conversation, resulting in smooth dialogues and impressive response performance. However, as AI becomes smarter, it may also cause unforeseen side effects that have not been previously experienced.The next image points out that AI may provide inconsistent answers. Even when asked the same question repeatedly, ChatGPT can yield the same or different responses. Often, the answers seem plausible or intriguing but may lack proper grounding since the AI can generate fictitious references.A humorous anecdote is shared regarding a fictional incident involving King Sejong of the Joseon Dynasty throwing a MacBook Pro. The text explains that this event is a made-up story since such technology did not exist during Sejong’s reign in the 15th century. The narrative illustrates Sejong's commitment to the development of Hangul, the Korean alphabet, and how he reacted in frustration during the writing process.The subsequent image addresses the phenomenon known as hallucination, where AI generates misleading information that appears credible. Users are advised to critically evaluate the outputs generated by ChatGPT and match them with reliable references.There are concerns about personal data breach and security. A recent incident involving the exposure of user data by ChatGPT is noted, where some users’ information was unintentionally disclosed for nine hours. OpenAI has acknowledged this error and reported the specifics of the data affected.The discussion of copyright issues raises questions about the originality of reports generated using ChatGPT. Whether the creative input of the user is sufficient for authorship recognition remains a contentious issue. The journal Science has declared that it will not permit the use of AI-generated text or data in its publications, while the journal Nature has a more lenient policy, allowing the use of AI as long as the involvement and methodologies are disclosed.The final section emphasizes the importance of not blindly trusting the results produced by AI and suggests double-checking information through credible sources. The CEO of OpenAI, Sam Altman, warns that AI can make significant mistakes and relying on it for important matters could lead to errors, indicating that there is still much work needed to improve its reliability and accuracy.The document concludes with a question about what we should learn in the age of ChatGPT, inviting further discussion on the topic.", "META": "Teaching and learning development institute"}

{"TEXT": "The content you provided discusses the impact of ChatGPT and artificial intelligence on education and outlines essential skills for the AI era. Below is a structured narrative based on the provided text, with all non-sentence elements and unnecessary symbols removed.---This document has been produced with the support of the University Innovation Support Project.The project, titled \"Understanding ChatGPT,\" aims to address the concerns of Kyung Hee University students who are unsure about where to begin with artificial intelligence. It poses essential questions regarding the educational implications of ChatGPT, such as whether it threatens or transforms education.Recent discussions in academia highlight that artificial intelligence, including ChatGPT, will not destroy education but rather change it for the better. For instance, Stephen Marche in The Atlantic emphasizes that the narrative around cheating does not capture the entire picture. There are educators who believe generative AI can enhance learning experiences.Moreover, educators are using AI tools in innovative ways during assessments. Some universities have integrated AI into their midterms, where students are tasked with identifying errors in AI-generated answers or using AI resources to support their essays. This approach signifies a shift towards assessing critical thinking and problem-solving skills rather than rote memorization.The document also outlines the essential skills that students must develop to effectively collaborate with AI. These skills include:- Critical Thinking: The ability to analyze situations and evaluate evidence without bias.- Creativity: The capacity to generate new ideas or recombine existing concepts to solve problems.- Conceptual Knowledge: Understanding core content across disciplines that can be applied to various situations.- Computational Thinking: The ability to define problems and devise solutions through systematic processes.- Convergence Skills: Integrating knowledge from different fields to address complex problems.- Character: Developing social-emotional competencies, including self-awareness, self-management, social awareness, relationship skills, and responsible decision-making.The document emphasizes that humans and AI should work in tandem rather than in competition. While AI can augment human capabilities, there are inherent human abilities such as creativity and empathy that AI cannot replicate. To thrive in the AI era, education must focus on developing both the capacity to use AI effectively and the unique human skills that remain irreplaceable. In conclusion, the \"Understanding ChatGPT\" project aims to equip students with the necessary tools to navigate the evolving landscape of education influenced by artificial intelligence.This marks the end of the \"Understanding ChatGPT\" project.--- The output is structured for clarity and coherence, suitable for machine learning tasks, and devoid of unnecessary symbols.", "META": "Teaching and learning development institute"}
