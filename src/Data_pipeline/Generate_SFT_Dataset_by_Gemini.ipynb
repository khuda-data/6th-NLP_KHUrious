      "1. The purpose of this standard is to present the criteria for awarding academic excellence and exemplary scholarships to the Department of Industrial and Management Engineering.\n",
      "2. The Industrial and Management Engineering Departments Academic Excellence and Model Scholarships are awarded to students who meet the College of Engineerings scholarship regulations and are selected based on the ranking of grades in the previous semester based on evaluation criteria. The scholarship amount and number of students selected may change depending on the scholarship budget each semester.\n",
      "3. The criteria for academic excellence and exemplary scholarships in the Department of Industrial and Management Engineering are as follows \n",
      "\n",
      "1st year students are limited to those who have completed at least 6 credits in the major basics and major required elective courses in the previous semester.\n",
      "2nd year students are limited to those who have completed at least 12 credits in the previous semester in the major basics and major required elective courses. (However at least 6 credits in the major required elective courses must be completed.)\n",
      "3rd year students are limited to those who have completed a total of 12 credits or more of required elective major courses in the previous semester.\n",
      "4th year students are limited to those who have completed a total of 9 credits or more in major required elective courses in the previous semester.\n",
      "Applicants for a double major are limited to those who have completed at least 9 credits in the major and 3 credits in the double major in the previous semester.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Model scholarships are awarded differentially when there are few students who meet the scholarship criteria or when there is a difference in the amount due to an increase in the external scholarship ratio.\n",
      "5. The standards for payment of external scholarships shall be determined by the national organization group or individual that has donated the scholarship. If no standards have been established the internal regulations of the College of Engineering and the scholarship regulations of this university shall apply.\n",
      "6. Matters not specified in these guidelines shall be deliberated and implemented by the department faculty meeting.\n",
